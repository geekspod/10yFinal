			<h1>How Much Can I Expect To Pay For A Private Chef?</h1>
			<p>Mar 5 2020</p>
			<p class="local">Private Chefs in America charge on average between $35 & $45 per hour, which generally doesn’t include anything beyond the skill of the Chef.  It will, however, cover the hardware the Chef needs to do their job from pots and pans to their prized Chef’s knives.  Cooking for a group of four or more can easily require six to eight hours, or $270 - $360.  That said, there are many factors that go into how much you’ll pay for your meals such as where you live, how many people are being served, the number of people required for the event, how many courses the meal is comprised of and much more. </p>

     		<h6>What type of professional is right for you?</h6>
     			<p class="many-pro">Many Chefs can make a menu, shop for the meal, cook it and even serve it or package it up to be enjoyed later.  That said, the cost to hire a Chef can vary greatly depending on many factors such as where you live, how many people are being served, the quality of the ingredients, the number of people required for the event, how many courses the meal is comprised of and much more.  In most cases you’re either choosing between Private Chefs and caterers.  Neither one is necessarily better than the other, but one of them are better for you and your needs.  We hope this guide will make it much easy for you to figure out which is best for you.</p>

     		<h5 class="local-com">Private Chefs</h5>	

     		<p class="many-pro">There are several Private Chefs that provide the growing list of food services we’ve grown accustomed to like meal prepping, dinner parties, catering, grocery shopping, cooking lessons, knife sharpening and daily meals.</p>
     		<p class="many-pro">Many Private Chefs operate by themselves which is a great setup for most.  It allows them to have freedom in their scheduling to be able to take whatever event they want without concern to the availability of others, it allows them to set their own pay rate and gives them the most control over the actual execution of the selected service. </p>

     		<p class="many-pro">Where it is more difficult for them, however, is the amount of people they can cater to.  At Savor The Passion we like to recommend that a Chef working by themselves not cook for more than 10 people at a time in order to ensure the highest quality.</p>
     		<p class="many-pro">Hiring Chefs that work alone is also great because its so much easier to arrange for them to cook for you and your guests when they don’t live locally often no even in the same time zone.  This will minimize costs of travel plus room and board.</p>
     		<h5 class="local-com">Caterers</h5>
     		<p class="many-pro">Oftentimes we have hosts reach out that want to have an event for more than ten people, but are sick of going to the same restaurants or someone that can’t go out to eat in a restaurant for medical reasons getting a Chef with a support staff is a great option.  These Chefs often refer to themselves as caterers.</p>

     		<p class="many-pro">These Chefs that act as caters often charge based on the amount of people that they serve at any given event as well as other things like required staff on hand & extra equipment required to serve a larger crowd of people like warming trays, servers, bartenders, ice.  Distance often plays a major role in determining how much your event will cost.  Depending on where you are often changes what the standard distance is (if not immediately) that you start getting charged a traveling fee.</p>

     		<h5 class="local-com">What services do Chefs Offer?</h5>

     		<p class="many-pro">The title Chef encompasses so many skills and services, but no Chef is great at everything and some Chefs simply aren’t interested in doing everything a Chef is capable of doing. </p>
     		
     		<h5 class="local-com">Meal Prepping</h5>
     		

     	      <p class="many-pro">There are so many reasons that people can use a Chef to meal prep.  Most often we see busy families that are simply strapped for time.  When a host needs a meal prep, they can contact a Private Chef where they will work together to build the perfect menu.  On average you can expect each serving of your meal to cost $10-$12. This service is best used with a local Chef that lives near you so that you don’t have to pay for traveling costs.</p>
     		<p class="many-pro">Tip: When first building a relationship with your Chef stay in the kitchen or a nearby room to watch your Chefs process while they prepare your meal.  Its up to you if & when you want to share a security code with your Chef to maximize your time while they cook for you.</p>

     		<p class="many-pro">Remember: they are just like a plumber, electrician or cable technician; they’re there to make your life better.</p>
     			
     		<h5  class="local-com">Dinner Party</h5>
     		<p class="many-pro">Private Chefs are frequently requested for dinner parties to celebrate all kinds of events in a person’s life.  Anniversaries, milestone birthdays, baby showers and many other events have proven great excuses to have a Private Chef attend and cook for a dinner party.</p>
     		<p class="many-pro">Chefs often have a number of menu items to choose from which have a price tag per person to them though there are times where a custom menu is required for an event.  The national average for the cost of a meal cooked by a Private Chef comes in around $45/person.  Truly passionate Chefs often have menus that are already designed for dietary restrictions like Celiac Disease, low-carb diets, low-sugar diets, low-sodium diets & many more restrictions.  A truly skilled Private Chef should have no problem making a custom menu for your meal of the day or evening.</p>
     		<p class="many-pro">Tip: Its best to ask your guests in advance if they have any dietary restrictions like allergies to make the menu design process go as quickly as possible.</p>
     		<p class="many-pro">Remember: Chefs are artistic so to really enjoy your Chef its best to give them an outline of what you’re looking for in a meal and allow them to fill in the blanks.</p>

			<h5 class="local-com">Standard vs. Full-Service Moving Costs</h5>
			<p class="many-pro">Hiring a full-service moving company might be your best option if you're too busy or need extra help with your move. Full-service moving typically includes:</p>
			<li style="padding-top: 10px;">A moving truck and moving boxes</li>
			<li style="padding-top: 10px;">Labor for packing household items into boxes</li>
			<li style="padding-top: 10px;">Loading boxes into the moving truck </li>
			<li style="padding-top: 10px;">Driving boxes and furniture to the new location</li>
			<li style="padding-top: 10px;">Unloading boxes into the new home</li>
			<li style="padding-top: 10px;">Unpacking items from boxes in your new home is generally not included but may be available for an additional cost.</li>
			<p class="many-pro">Full-service moving companies typically request that you be present the day of packing and moving, although other arrangements can sometimes be made for people who are traveling.</p>
			<p class="many-pro">The cost of local full-service moving is greater than for standard moving services, but the payoff comes in the free time you have not spent packing up all your possessions.</p>
			<h5 class="local-com">Cost to Move a 3-Bedroom House:</h5>
			<div class="table-responsive">
				<table class="table">

							<tr>

					   </tbody>
					</table>
				</div>
				<p class="many-pro">With a standard move, your boxes are packed and ready to go the day the movers come. When they arrive, you can step back and let them do the heavy lifting. They'll also drive your belongings across town and unload them for you in your new place.</p>
				<p class="many-pro">Standard local moves are attractive for the price savings they offer, as well as providing more control for people who want their items packed in a specific way.</p>
				<p class="many-pro">Here are examples of average costs for a standard move and a full-service move from Texas Elite Moving:</p>
				<h5 class="local-com">A full-service move for a three-bedroom house:</h5><p class="many-pro"> This cost includes three people packing for approximately four hours and five or six hours of loading, moving and unloading time.</p> 
				<h5 class="local-com">Standard moving service for a three-bedroom house: </h5>
				<p class="many-pro">$1,000-$1,500. This cost includes three people and five or six hours of loading, moving and unloading time.</p>

				<h5 class="local-com">Number of Movers (and How Many Hours They Work)</h5>
				<p class="many-pro">The cost to hire professional local movers is often calculated on an hourly rate, which can increase as more movers or moving trucks are needed. Your geographic location will also affect your hourly rate.</p>
				<p class="many-pro">Often, cities with a higher cost of living have higher local moving rates than smaller cities with a lower cost of living, which accounts for higher costs of doing business, such as workers' comp, insurance and labor. For example, Elite Moving San Diego, Inc. charges an hourly rate that increases with each additional mover you require. Two movers are $105 per hour, three movers are $135 per hour and four movers are $155 per hour.</p>
				<p class="many-pro">Texas Elite Moving, based in Dripping Springs, Texas, has estimated hourly rates that vary based on the number of movers and trucks. Its hourly rates also account for furniture assembly and disassembly as needed. The company's trucks arrive with premium quilted moving pads and shrink-wrap to protect items, and the movers use equipment and dollies to maximize efficiency.</p>
				<p class="many-pro">Individual job prices will always depend on your circumstances, so for exact quotes, it's important to communicate directly with the moving company you plan to hire. Here are the  average estimated base hourly moving rates for Texas Elite Moving:</p>
				<div class="table-responsive">
					<table class="table">
						<tr>
							<td>2 moves 1 truck</td>
							<td>$100 per hour</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>3 moves 1 truck</td>
							<td>$145 per hour</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>4 moves 1 truck</td>
							<td>$190 per hour</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>4 moves 2 truck</td>
							<td>$200 per hour</td>
						</tr>

				</div>
				<h5 class="local-com">Number of Rooms in Your Home</h5>
				<p class="many-pro">In general, the larger the house, the higher the moving cost. Seasoned movers often can provide a ballpark number for moving costs based on the number and type of rooms in a house. However, your home might be different, and that's why most moving companies will need to do a site visit to provide you with a true estimate for services.</p>
				<p class="many-pro">Home size is not always an indicator of how many belongings a person has. For example, you and your partner may have more items in your two-bedroom apartment than a single person has in a three-bedroom home.</p>
				<h5 class="local-com">Stairs and Other Obstacles</h5>
				<p class="many-pro">
					Other factors that may affect your hourly rate are logistical challenges such as stairs or steep driveways, or having many fragile items that require extremely delicate handling.
				</p>
				<p class="many-pro">
					Anything that makes the move take longer or that demands more physical exertion on the part of the movers can increase the cost. Stairs at the initial move site or the new destination can increase moving costs because they require more work for movers and present more risk of injury or damage. Narrow passageways, steep driveways, lack of parking out front, and the presence or absence of elevators are other factors that can influence your local moving costs.
				</p>
				<p class="many-pro">
					How movers charge for obstacles may depend on the company. Some moving companies have set rates for stairs, such as $50 to $70 per flight of stairs. If you live on a top floor and the moving company has to transport all of your belongings down in the elevator, they may have a one-time fee, such as $75 to $100.
				</p>
				<p class="many-pro">
					During your initial call with the movers, it's important to provide as many details as possible. This allows them to provide you with the most accurate estimate and to ensure the safest and most efficient move for your belongings. They'll be able to bring any special necessary equipment needed to navigate the obstacles or maneuver furniture in tight places.
